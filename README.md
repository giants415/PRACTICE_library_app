#**Library App**

Heroku Link : [Andrew's Library App](https://secret-thicket-91944.herokuapp.com/)

Rails has made the creation of a CRUD app an incredibly simple and (mostly) straightforward process. Authentication/authorization are also really great to begin using as my apps move towards projects that could be used by a general audience. It was also good to get more practice with Heroku and rails.
